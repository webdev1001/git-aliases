# git-aliases
A list of nice git aliases


###Installation

Copy the aliases from gitaliases.txt to your ~/.gitconfig and `[alias]`. They will be available the next time you use `git`.

###Content

These are aliases that i use everyday, a few short versions of common commands and a few alternative logging aliases (Try them, not the usual "git log"!)
To sum up:

	st        = status
	co        = checkout
	br        = branch
	ad = add -A .        This add every new,remove,modified file to staging
	
	//Better git log, with or without brances graph
	lg,lgf
	
	// Waaaay better git log, 50 cols wide, with and without branch graph, with colors!
	l50, lg50
	    
	// Waaaay better git log, 80 cols wide, with and without branch graph, with colors!
